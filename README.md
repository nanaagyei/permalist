## Features

- **Create Tasks:** Users can add new tasks to their to-do list.
- **Edit Tasks:** Users can modify the title of existing tasks.
- **Delete Tasks:** Users can remove tasks from their to-do list.
- **Persistent Storage:** Tasks are stored in a PostgreSQL database, ensuring data persistence between server restarts.

## Technologies Used

- **Express.js:** A web application framework for Node.js used to handle routing and server-side logic.
- **Body-Parser:** Middleware for parsing incoming request bodies, essential for handling form data.
- **PostgreSQL:** A powerful, open-source relational database used to store task information.
- **EJS:** Embedded JavaScript templating engine used for rendering dynamic HTML pages with data from the server.
